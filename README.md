### Criminal-database-management-system
The main purpose of our project is automating the traditional way of storing criminal records.
Here, we could add, update and delete criminal records. We could also add, update and delete
FIR details which are being filed down manually traditionally. We store all the data into a
database from where we could use it further. Thus this project provides a very user friendly
interface for the officials to store and manage the criminal records.
### Project Objective
  This project intends to provide an effective way for storing, retrieving and managing criminal
records. It also aims at providing a user friendly interface for effortless interaction with the
user. 
### Project Scope
This project is confined to storing, retrieving and managing criminal records. In further
developments of the project, we could integrate it with AI and make features such as face
detections.
